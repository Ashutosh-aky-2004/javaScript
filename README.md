# 🌟 Welcome to My JavaScript Projects Repository!

Hi there! 👋  
This repository is a curated collection of my JavaScript-based mini projects. As a passionate beginner in the world of web development, I'm using this space to explore and experiment with different features and concepts in JavaScript.

Each project below represents a learning milestone — whether it’s mastering DOM manipulation, handling events, or replicating real-world apps. I’ll continue to add more as I grow!
